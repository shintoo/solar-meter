Solar Meter

Function:
    Display 5V solar cell voltage on an 8-LED display
    By default scaled 0V to 5V. Also included is a 1.2V
    to 1.5V scale for use with an AA battery (See the
    Tables section in src/solar-meter.asm).

Platform: AVR ATMega328P
AREF is Vcc, 5V.
Assembler: avra
Depends: m328Pdef.inc
Configuration:
        PC0     -> Solar cell +
